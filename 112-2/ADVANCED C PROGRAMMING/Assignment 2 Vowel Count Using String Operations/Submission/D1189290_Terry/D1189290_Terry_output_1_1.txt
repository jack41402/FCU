The Gift of the Magi
by O Henry
 
One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was al
l. And sixty cents of it in the smallest pieces of money - pennies. Pennies save
d one and two at a time by negotiating with the men at the market who sold veget
ables and meat. Negotiating until ones face burned with the silent knowledge of 
being poor. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And
 the next day would be Christmas.

There was clearly nothing to do but sit down 
and cry. So Della cried. Which led to the thought that life is made up of little
 cries and smiles, with more little cries than smiles.

Della finished her cryin
g and dried her face. She stood by the window and looked out unhappily at a gray
 cat walking along a gray fence in a gray back yard. Tomorrow would be Christmas
