# 7.2 (Broadcasting) Use arange to create a 2-by-2 array containing the numbers 0â€“3.
# Use broadcasting to perform each of the following operations on the original array:
# a) Cube every element of the array.
# b) Add 7 to every element of the array.
# c) Multiply every element of the array by 2.

import numpy as np

# Create a 2-by-2 array containing the numbers 0-3

# a) Cube every element of the array.

# b) Add 7 to every element of the array.

# c) Multiply every element of the array by 2.
