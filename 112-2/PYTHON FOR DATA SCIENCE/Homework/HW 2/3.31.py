# 3.31 (Intro to Data Science: Categorical Data) Mean, median and mode work well with numerical values. You can use
# them in calculations and arrange them in meaningful order. Categorical values are descriptive names like Boxer,
# Poodle, Collie, Beagle, Bulldog and Chihuahua. Normally, you donâ€™t use these in calculations nor associate an order
# with them. Which if any of the descriptive statistics are appropriate for categorical data?

# ANSWER
# Among mean, median, and mode, the mode is the most appropriate descriptive statistic for categorical data.
# Categorical data consists of labels or names without inherent numerical meaning or order. The mode represents the
# most frequently occurring category and can provide valuable insights into the distribution of categorical variables.
