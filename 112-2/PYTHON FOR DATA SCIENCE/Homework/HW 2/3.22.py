# 3.22 (Optional else Clause of a Loop) The while and for statements each have an optional else clause. In a while
# statement, the else clause executes when the condition becomes False. In a for statement, the else clause executes
# when there are no more items to process. If you break out of a while or for that has an else, the else part does
# not execute. Execute the following code to see that the else clause executes only if the break statement does not:

for i in range(2):
    value = int(input('Enter an integer (-1 to break): '))
    print('You entered:', value)
    if value == -1:
        break
else:
    print('The loop terminated without executing the break')
